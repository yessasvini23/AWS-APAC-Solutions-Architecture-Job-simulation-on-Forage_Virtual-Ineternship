 AWS APAC Solutions Architecture Simulation on Forage 🌟
I recently completed the AWS APAC Solutions Architecture simulation on Forage,

where I:

🏗️ Designed a simple, scalable hosting architecture using Elastic Beanstalk to support a client facing rapid growth and slow response times.
💬 Explained the proposed solution in clear, non-technical language to ensure the client fully understood the architecture's functionality and cost structure.
This project allowed me to strengthen my cloud architecture skills and apply practical solutions to real-world challenges. 🚀
